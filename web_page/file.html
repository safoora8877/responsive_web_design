        </header>
        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Art is a powerful means of human expression that spans across cultures
          and centuries. It reflects emotions, ideas, history, imagination, and
          innovation. Different forms of art serve various purposes — from
          storytelling to decoration, protest to praise, therapy to
          transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This documentation outlines the major forms of art, including their
          definitions, characteristics, examples, and importance.

        <h1>Definition</h1>
        <p>
          Visual arts are forms of art that are primarily visual in nature. They
          are appreciated through sight and often created using tools like
          brushes, pencils, or digital software

        </header>
        <h1>Definition</h1>
        <p>
          These arts are performed live in front of an audience and include
          movement, sound, and expression.
        </p>

        <p>
          Performing arts are dynamic and live, created through body movement,
          voice, or musical instruments. They include music, dance, theatre, and
          opera. These forms are meant to be experienced in real-time, often in
          front of an audience. Performing artists use rhythm, timing,
          expression, and physicality to engage and move spectators emotionally.
          For instance, ballet tells stories through elegant dance, while
          theatre uses dramatic dialogue and action to portray human
          experiences. Music, whether classical, folk, or modern, is a universal
          language that expresses mood, culture, and identity.

          3. Literary Arts
        </header>
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Literary art uses words to express emotions, stories, and ideas
          through written or spoken language.
        </p>

        <p>
          Literary arts focus on the written and spoken word. These include
          poetry, fiction, non-fiction, prose, and drama. Through storytelling,
          metaphor, rhythm, and language, literary artists explore the depth of
          human thought and feeling. A novel might offer insights into social
          injustice, while a poem may capture the fleeting beauty of a moment.
          Literary arts preserve culture, stimulate imagination, and encourage
          empathy by allowing readers to live vicariously through other lives
          and experiences.
        </p>

        <h3>Details:</h3>
        <p>
          Literary arts focus on the beauty and power of language, whether
          through poetry, fiction, drama, or non-fiction. Through written and
          spoken word, literary arts allow artists to share complex ideas,
          emotions, and stories across cultures and generations. Applied arts
          bring aesthetics into practical design—architecture, fashion, interior
          and industrial design, and jewelry-making are all examples where
          beauty and functionality merge. Closely related are the decorative
          arts, which focus on ornamental and craft-based works like ceramics,
          glass, textiles, and furniture, often enhancing both form and function
          in everyday objects.

        <p>Some of the most ones are listed below:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="italics">Hamlet by William Shakespeare (Drama)</li>
          <li class="italics">Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen (Fiction)</li>
          <li class="italics">GLeaves of Grass by Walt Whitman (Poetry)</li>

        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p>
          Applied arts combine design and decoration with everyday objects,
          making them both functional and beautiful.
        </p>

        <p>
          Applied arts blend aesthetics with function, aiming to make useful
          objects beautiful. Unlike fine arts which exist primarily for
          admiration, applied arts involve practical design. Architecture, for
          instance, is the art of designing buildings that are both functional
          and visually striking. Interior design enhances living or working
          spaces with harmony and style. Fashion design turns clothing into a
          statement of personal or cultural expression, while industrial and
          product design ensures that everyday objects—like furniture or
          gadgets—are ergonomic, attractive, and efficient.
